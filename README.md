In this repository you'll find an example on how to use a ray marcher as shading for a `jit.gl.gridshape` and have it be part of the jitter world using the same camera as the other objects. Inspired and ported from the great Art of Code tutorial about using GLSL shading on a cube in Unity. With some help by Jaromir Mulders. sdf compositing and shape primitives functions from the GL3 package examples, which are taken from Inigo Quilez.
